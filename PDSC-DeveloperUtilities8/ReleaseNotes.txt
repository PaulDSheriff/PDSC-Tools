PDSC Developer Utilities v8.0.1 - 10/4/2023
-----------------------------------------------------
Renamed the create*.cmd and instructions*.txt files to put the technology name first
  MAUI-CreateSolution.cmd, MVC-CreateSolution.cmd, etc.
Add a CodeGen-FilesToDelete.xml file
  The WebAPI-CreateSolution.cmd and WebAPI-Instructions*.txt files are now deleted if generating a .NET MAUI application
Added a configuration setting so if you download a new version of the PDSC Developer Utilities and changes have been made to the templates or XML files, the old ones are automatically deleted, and the new ones are copied over.
  <add key="DeleteTemplatesXml" value="true"/>
  After copying the new ones, this value is reset to false
Fixed bug where the primary key field did not match the 'TableNameId' format
